Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Example 2:

Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

Example 3:

Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

Right, so bit manipulation. This is important and sometime trips me up. 

Usually for these problems we want to use the various logic operations (&&, ||, |=, &=, etc) as well as bit shifting (>>, <<) to figure out a solution like a puzzle. 

For this problem, the naÃ¯ve way to do this would be to use a loop where while the number is not zero, we '&' it with 1, and increases a counter if true. Then bit shift right by one.


```
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(n != 0){
	        if(n & 1){
		        count++;
	        }
	        n = n >> 1;
        }
        
        return count;
        
    }
};
```

this works and is O(n) where n is the number of bits in the given integer.
